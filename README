== Intro ==

This project implements a custom, full-featured OpenERP module currently used by an italian language school to manage students and courses.

== Why open ==
The code is strongly customized to meet customer's needs (which are very particular), so I don't think it'll be useful as a general purpose module for schools. Anyway, the code shows several keypoints a developer meets while writing an OpenERP extension module, so I think it's worth to keep it available for the community as a reference. The license is GPLv3.

== Features ==
The module depends on poweremail module written by Sharoon Thomas (http://openlabs.co.in) and shows how to implement custom templates which support attachments.

It also depends on report_openoffice module (http://kndati.lv/index.php/en/openerp/open-erp-addons/reporting-engine) and uses .odt files as report templates.

Other features in random order:
 * Models inheritance across modules
 * Views inheritance across modules
 * Data loading at startup
 * Demo data
 * Module-level localization
 * ORM tips'n'tricks
